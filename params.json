{"name":"Same","tagline":"Juego SAME en LOGO","body":"### SAME Game Project.\r\nThe goal of this project is to learn basic programming skills such as variables, control structures, loops and recursivity. The LOGO environment provides a simple syntax for students that don't have previous programming knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Installation of LOGO environment.\r\nFirst, you need a DOS emulator. I recommend DOSBox, you can get it from here http://www.dosbox.com/ or if you are on Linux you can install it from the repositories.\r\nIf you are on Windows you can drag the LOGOWR.COM file right into the DOSBox icon and you are ready to start. If you are using Linux you need to do a couple of things before:\r\nClone the repository or extract it in your home folder. Open a console and type\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ dosbox\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, in the DOSBox console type\r\n\r\n```\r\nZ:\\> mount c /home/$USER/SAME\r\nZ:\\> c:\r\nC:\\> logowr\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow that you have opened the LOGO environment open the SAME file which is kind of the main file.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
